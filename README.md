Dr Brain Action Reaction is a puzzle game developed by Knowledge Adventure. It is part a game series originally developed by Sierra. The game uses Unreal Engine 1.

This is a decompilation of the .u package files containing all the assets for the game, which I have done with other UE1 based games. Since the game didn't come with the UnrealEd executable and I wasn't able to get the 224 patch UnrealEd executable to work, I used [WOTgreal](https://ut99.org/ut99.org/viewtopic.php?t=14963) to export the files instead. I also uploaded the assets instead of just the .uc files, which I didn't do with the other games. 

I don't really plan on using any of this to make a patch for the game or anything like that, I was just curious about how the game worked.

None of the code or assets have been modified. Though some of the asset files may have been exported incorrectly.
